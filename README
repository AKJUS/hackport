Hackport
========

About
-----

Hackport is a utility application for Gentoo Linux to ease the tasks for the
Haskell Project.

The main purpose for Hackport is to interact with Hackage and create
Ebuilds from Cabal packages. It also does handy functions to compare
hackage, the overlay and the portage tree.

Features
--------

    'hackport update'
        Update the local copy of hackage's package list. You should run this
        every once in a while to get a more recent copy.
    
    'hackport list [FILTER]'
        Print packages from hackage, with an optional substring matching.

    'hackport merge <package>'
        Create a Gentoo Linux Ebuild for hackage package named <package>.
        The category defaults to dev-haskell, but is overridden if an older
        version has been merged previously to another category. The category
        can also be overridden with the syntax category/package. Example:

            $ hackport merge x11-wm/xmonad

        Hackport will make an ebuild that uses the haskell-cabal eclass, and
        set the following properties:

        PN (package name)
            Package name converted into lower case
        PV (package version)
            Package version with tags dropped.
        KEYWORDS
            Defaults to ~amd64 ~x86
        CABAL_FEATURES
            Set to "bin" for executables, and "lib haddock profile" for
            libraries. Packages that contains both a binary and library will
            get the union.
        DEPEND
            GHC dependency defaults to >=dev-lang/ghc-6.6.1.
            Cabal dependency is fetched from Cabal field 'Cabal-Version'.
            All other package dependencies are converted into gentoo syntax.
            Range dependencies are flattened and usually needs manual
            tweaking.
        DESCRIPTION
            From Synopsis if it is non-empty, otherwise Description.
        HOMEPAGE
            From Homepage
        SRC_URI
            From package url
        LICENSE 
            From cabal license converted into gentoo licenses
        SLOT
            Defaults to "0"

    'hackport diff [missing|additions|newer|common]'
        Prints a list showing a diff between hackage and the overlay.
        For each package it shows the latest version in both hackage and the
        overlay.


        Optional parameters:
            default action
                List all packages.
            'missing'
                List packages that exist in hackage but not in the overlay,
                or where the hackage version is more recent.
            'additions' 
                List packages only in the overlay, or where the overlay has
                a more recent version.
            'newer'
                List packages where hackage has a more recent version.
            'common'
                List packages where hackage and the overlay has the same
                version.
