Hackport
========

About
-----

Hackport is a utility application for Gentoo Linux to ease the tasks for the
Haskell Project.

The main purpose for Hackport is to interact with Hackage and create
Ebuilds from Cabal packages. It also does handy functions to compare
hackage, the overlay and the portage tree.

Features
--------
    
    'hackport list [FILTER]'
        Print packages from hackage, with optional substring matching.

    'hackport merge <package>'
        Create a Gentoo Linux Ebuild for hackage package named <package>.
        The category defaults to dev-haskell, but is overridden if an older
        version has been merged previously to another category. The category
        can also be overridden with the syntax category/package. Example:

            $ hackport merge x11-wm/xmonad

        Hackport will make an ebuild that uses the haskell-cabal eclass, and
        set the following properties:

        PN (package name)
            Package name converted into lower case
        PV (package version)
            Package version with tags dropped.
        KEYWORDS
            Defaults to ~amd64 ~x86
        CABAL_FEATURES
            Set to "bin" for executables, and "lib haddock profile" for
            libraries. Packages that contains both a binary and library will
            get the union.
        DEPEND
            GHC dependency defaults to >=dev-lang/ghc-6.6.1.
            Cabal dependency is fetched from Cabal field 'Cabal-Version'.
            All other package dependencies are converted into gentoo syntax.
            Range dependencies are flattened and usually needs manual
            tweaking.
